# The origins of Pokemon names

This project aims to categorise many dimensions of Pokemon name etymology.

It will answer questions like:
- Why are Pokemon named like they are?
- What does each part of Pokemon names mean?
- What patterns can be seen in the meaning of the names?

Unlike most other Pokemon data analysis, numerical stats are not relevant here.
